## About this Project

This project is a neural network written in Zig to classify fashion items from the Fashion MNIST dataset. It is a work in progress. The [Fashion MNIST dataset](https://github.com/zolandoresearch/fashion-mnist) is a drop-in replacement for the [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) of handwritten digits. It is intended to serve as a direct comparison for machine learning algorithms.

This project is a work in progress. The goals of this project are:

- To implement a neural network from scratch in Zig.
- To learn more about the internals of neural networks.
- To serve as a supplement to the Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence course that I am taking at Texas A&M University - San Antonio.
- To improve my Zig skills.
